This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful machine learning classification task using the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Key Features:
✅ Dataset: Uses the built-in Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
✅ Model: Implements Logistic Regression for classification (easily extendable to other models like SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
✅ Data Preprocessing: Includes feature scaling using StandardScaler for better model performance.
✅ Evaluation: Measures accuracy and generates a classification report.
✅ Modular Code: Easy to modify for other classification tasks.

Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, StandardScaler)

NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib (optional visualization)

Learning Outcomes:
Understanding supervised learning and classification.

Handling train-test splits and feature scaling.

Evaluating model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.

Use Case:
Great for beginners learning ML basics or as a template for simple classification projects.
